Playback & navigation

Choose Loop (repeat the current snippet) or Cont. (play straight through).

Tap Speed to cycle between 1.0× → 0.75× → 0.5×.

Set a pause between repeats (0–5 seconds) when looping.

Use the built-in audio bar to scrub through the full episode.

Drag the blue handle on the right to scroll quickly; release to snap to and play the nearest card. It’s always usable—even if it overlaps the yellow button.

Use the yellow floating button: tap = next snippet, long-press = move the button (no previous action).

Click any triplet to make it active and play from there; the page won’t recenter unless it needs to.

Interface

Clean header with a soft, animated gradient.

A compact, sticky bar with: Menu · Loop/Cont. · Pause · Speed · Play/Pause.

A font-size slider (in Menu) that adjusts only the content area.

Chinese text is larger than Pinyin and English for easier reading.

Display options: Dark mode; hide/show Pinyin; hide/show English.

Each Chinese line includes a Pleco button for quick lookups.

Your progress (auto-save)

TingDu remembers everything in one place: your last collection, last snippet and time per collection, speed, pause setting, Loop/Cont., display options, content font size, and the positions of the blue handle and yellow button.

When you come back, TingDu reopens the last collection and jumps to where you left off.
